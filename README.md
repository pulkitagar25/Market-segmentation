This is a Segmentation Analysis using Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm (K-Means Clustering) for mall customer data in India.
First pre-processing tasks are performed to get the better idea about the dataset. Then features are selected based on which clustering is performed using K-Means algorithm.And The Elbow method is a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within-cluster analysis designed to help to find the appropriate number of clusters in a dataset.
Then optimum number of clusters are determined using WCSS curve and then based on Annual Income and Spending Score of the customers, they are clustered.
So, this is how this Segmentation Analysis works.
